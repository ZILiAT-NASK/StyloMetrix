    "StyloMetrix is a tool for stylometric analysis of texts. It is based on Spacy and supports four languages. In order for the tool to work properly, a corresponding language model is required. Below is the list of supported languages and their corresponding models:\n",
    "- English [en_core_web_trf](https://spacy.io/models/en)\n",
    "- German [de_core_news_lg](https://spacy.io/models/de)\n",

    "- Ukrainian [uk_core_web_trf](https://spacy.io/models/uk)\n",

    "The model must be downloaded and installed in the environment where SM will be used. StyloMetrix is installed using `pip install stylo_metrix`.\n",
